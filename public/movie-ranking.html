<h4>Why I like this movie!</h4>
<p>
    It´s a film from Quentin Tarantino. One of the best regisseur in my opinion.<br />
    Tarantino delivers ‘a harmonious, expectedly shrill mix of rough western,
    revenge drama and slavery portrait.<br />
</p>

<h3>2. The Hatful Eight</h3>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3460252/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_the%2520hatefull"><img src="../assets/images/TheHatefulEight.jpg" alt="The Hateful Eight Movie Cover Link to IMDB Homepage" height="200"></a>

<h4>Why I like this movie!</h4>
<p>
  It´s also an film from Quentin Tarantino Where he play an small role by his own.
  This is a fine piece of storytelling - a mystery, western, and political drama<br />
  - all artfully melded together. If you like western movies in a new kind of
  style you would like this film.<br />
</p>

<h3>3. Bullet Train</h3>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12593682/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><img src="../assets/images/BulletTrain.jpg" alt="Bullet Train Movie Cover Link to IMDB Homepage" height="200"></a>

<h4>Why I like this movie!</h4>
<p>
  I like this movie! It was so much fun to watch and the dialogues between the
  different parties in the film are fantastic.<br />
  Also you don´t know the end of the story until the end of the movie. And that
  will captivating you.<br />
</p>
<h3>4. Lucky Number Slevin</h3>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425210/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_lucky%2520number"><img src="../assets/images/LuckyNumberSlevin.jpg" alt="Lucky Number Slevin Movie Cover Link to IMDB Homepage" height="200"></a>

<h4>Why I like this movie!</h4>
<p>
  I like this movie because it´s exciting and captivating until the End. And
  like the movie Bullet Train you also didn´t know how the story will End. So if<br />
  you want to know how the story will end you can´t turn off the TV after 5
  minutes simply. You have to watch the full Movie.<br />
</p>
<h3>5. Gran Turismo</h3>

<h4>Why I like this movie!</h4>

  I like racing movies which based on a real story. And that´s what Grand
  Tourismo is. Awesome!<br />
